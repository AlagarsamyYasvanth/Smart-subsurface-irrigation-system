# Smart-subsurface-irrigation-system

This smart irrigation system is a device, which is arduino based, and it uses sensors to detect the water requirement of your plant/crop or soil. Once it gets the signal about lack of moisture content in soil or low water level in the fields (based on the set criteria in the arduino UNO code), it will automatically provide for the water supply to the target area. It is easy to use, water saving, cost effective modern irrigation technique.
